Custom Oh My Zsh Plugin for [xxh](https://github.com/xxh/xxh) to be used in conjunction with my cli-tools plugin [ninagrosse/xxh-plugin-prerun-cli-tools](https://github.com/ninagrosse/xxh-plugin-prerun-cli-tools). 

Besides [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) the plugin also installs [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The cli-tools plugin is required, because `pluginrc.zsh` uses plugins, settings and aliases for those tools.
